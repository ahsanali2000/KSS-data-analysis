main-> auxalary tables
first api check only main tables
second worked for tables as well
***
# From all valid terms we are interested in depth of main terms


How many terms found in catalog are valid. which of these are dewey  numbers and which are built numbers.

******
main question is "Whether terms typically comes from top or bottom of dictionary."

create three histograms for the length of each term
one for valid terms from dewey number
one for valid terms from builtnumer(without table numbers)
one of togather all valid terms



from the complex terms built number extract simple number


# Evaluation
why we choosed this approach for this task
we tested different APIs
reserach libraries etc


# add the stats in graphical form


use terms of

Valid invalid
deway number
built number

It is possible that the term is valid but the API does not resolve it.
There is also possiblity that the data if from another origin.

This data is from belguim libarary.

# in introduction talk about dewey classification
